Hi, my name is Roland Riachi! I am a MSc Mathematics and Statistics student at McGill University, under the supervisor of Professor Linan Chen.

My interests primarily revolve around probability theory and computer science. More specifically, my current focus includes stochastic differential equations (SDEs), Gaussian Free Fields, and theoretical machine learning.

Many thanks to Github's automatic repository name generator for suggesting this apt name for this blog! I plan to use this platform as a means for practising writing and documenting my progression as a mathematician. Along the way, I hope that anyone who stumbles upon this project can take something away from reading my posts.
